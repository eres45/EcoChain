## üåü Overview

The environmental impact of cryptocurrency mining is significant and growing. EcoChain Guardian aims to incentivize more sustainable mining practices by:

1. **Monitoring** mining operations worldwide
2. **Analyzing** their environmental impact using AI/ML
3. **Scoring** them on sustainability metrics
4. **Rewarding** eco-friendly miners with ERC-20 tokens and NFT badges

By creating financial incentives for sustainable practices, EcoChain Guardian helps drive the crypto industry toward environmental responsibility.

- ‚úÖ **Community Governance**: Contract deployment and governance features operate as expected

#### 2. Auto Contract Management
- ‚úÖ **Contract Deployment**: Successfully deploys simulated contracts
- ‚úÖ **Score Updates**: Successfully updates individual and batch miner scores
- ‚úÖ **Distribution Schedules**: Creates and manages distribution schedules
- ‚úÖ **Manual/Automated Distribution**: Both reward distribution methods work correctly

#### 3. Agent Components
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Genner Tests**: Requires API keys for OpenRouter/Anthropic
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Marketing Agent**: Requires Twitter API configuration
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Trading Agent**: Requires blockchain configuration

### Running Tests

You can run our test suite using the following commands:

```bash
# Run the demo script to test core functionality
python ecochain/demo.py

# Test the auto contract functionality
python agent/scripts/test_auto_contract.py

# Generate a comprehensive test summary
python test_summary.py
```

### Test Summary Tool

We've developed a custom test summary tool that provides a clear, formatted overview of all test results. This tool helps judges and evaluators quickly understand the state of our platform's components.

```bash
# Run the test summary tool
python test_summary.py
```
